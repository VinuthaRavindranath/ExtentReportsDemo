# ExtentReportsDemo

ExtentReports is an open-source reporting library useful for test automation. It can be easily integrated with major testing frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, TestNG, etc. These reports are HTML documents that depict results as pie charts. They also allow the generation of custom logs, snapshots, and other customized details.

Once an automated test script runs successfully, testers need to generate a test execution report. While TestNG does provide a default report, they do not provide the details.
